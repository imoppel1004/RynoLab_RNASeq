RNA Seq Workflow
Ryno Lab 2023
Authors: Jason Kuchtey & Isabella Moppel

Process:
1. Download all files from GitHub
2. Make sure the following programs are installed and up-to-date on your computer: gzip, sickle, salmon, R, Rstudio (some of these are big and might take a long time to install)
3. If the paired read files are gzipped, unzip them with “gzip -d <filename>”
4. Run cleanQuant.sh on each set of paired reads: move eColi_transcriptome_fasta.fa and cleanQuant.sh into the parent directory containing the paired reads, and run "bash cleanQuant.sh" from the command line (from that directory). Will take 15-30mins for each set of paired reads. Should get a mapping rate >60% (this sounds low but don’t worry, the reads are also being trimmed in this process which will lower the mapping rate)
5. Open BioC_Workflow_IMJK.R in RStudio. Set the working directory to the directory containing the directories containing the paired reads (not a typo, more details in comments in R code). Make sure that BOTH EColi_k12.gff3.gz and EColi_k12.gff3 are in this working directory. Run the code chunk by chunk. PLEASE read the comments above each chunk of code, sometimes there are things you'll have to do before you run it.
Analyses are optional, take them or leave them. Read the comments!
