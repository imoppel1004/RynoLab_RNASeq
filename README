RNA Seq Workflow
Ryno Lab 2023
Authors: Jason Kuchtey & Isabella Moppel

Process:
1. Download all files from GitHub.
2. Run cleanQuant.sh on each set of paired reads: copy adapters.fasta, refSeq1.fna,
   EColi_k12_cdna.all.fa, and cleanQuant.sh into the parent directory containing the
   paired reads (which can remain in .gz form), and run "bash cleanQuant.sh" from the
   command line. Will take ~5 - ~60 minutes for each set of paired reads, depending on
   how many you're running at a time (I've run ~20 at a time).
3. Open BioC_Workflow_IMJK.R in RStudio. Make sure that EColi_k12_gff3.gz is in the same
   directory as BioC_Workflow_IMJK.R. Set the working directory to the directory containing
   the directory containing the paired reads (more details in comments in R code). Run the
   code chunk by chunk. PLEASE read the comments above each chunk of code, sometimes there
   are things you'll have to do before you run that chunk.
   Main time constraints:
    - Installing packages: 5-20 mins
    - Converting EcoGene IDs to Entrez Gene IDs: ~3-4 hrs
    - Converting Entrez Gene IDs to Official Gene Symbols: ~2 hrs? Ran overnight so not sure
   Analyses are optional, take them or leave them. Read the comments!
